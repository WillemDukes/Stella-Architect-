        <h2>Integrated Science &amp; Technology Student</h2>
        <p>
          I am a sophomore ISAT student with interests in
          systems thinking, sustainability,
          and applied problem-solving.
          I enjoy translating complex systems into clear, real-world solutions
          through hands-on projects.

          <h2>Dynamics model of how Infectious Disease Spread</h2>
          <p><strong>ISAT 290 | Final Project</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>
         James Madison University has an exclusive science major called ISAT (Integrated Science and Technology). 
         This major is supposed to be a very broad science major that can lead to many  different fields,
          such as environmental sustainability, data science, systems engineering, etc. In ISAT 290, a class focused
          on modeling feedback loops, my classmates and I created an infection diagram in Stella Architect to model 
          how an infectious disease would realistically behave.
        </p>
        <p>
           This Stella Architect model simulates the spread of an infectious disease through a population using an 
        extended SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework. Individuals transition between susceptible, 
        exposed, infected, hospitalized, quarantined, recovered, and deceased states based on contact rates, time delays,
        and behavioral responses. The model incorporates public health interventions such as vaccination, quarantine, and
        social distancing, while also tracking cumulative outcomes including total deaths, hospitalizations, and economic costs. 
        By allowing users to adjust intervention parameters and observe resulting feedback loops, the model demonstrates how 
        behavioral and policy decisions influence both health and economic outcomes during an outbreak.

     <p><strong>What this Model Reveals</strong></p>   
        <p>
         Interacting with the model highlights how small changes in behavior and policy can produce
          large differences in outcomes over time. Adjustments to vaccination effectiveness, quarantine
          participation, or social distancing quickly alter infection curves, hospitalization demand, and total costs.
          The model demonstrates how reinforcing feedback loops can accelerate disease spread, while balancing loops—such
          as increased awareness and intervention—can slow or stabilize outbreaks.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What I Learned as a Modeler</strong></p>
     <p>Building this system reinforced the importance of accounting for delays, nonlinear relationships, and human
        behavior when modeling complex systems. Factors such as delayed symptom onset, time in quarantine, and partial 
        compliance significantly affect system behavior and make simple cause-and-effect assumptions unreliable.
        The project emphasized the value of system dynamics as a tool for understanding real-world problems that cannot 
        be captured through static analysis alone.</p>

        
          <strong>Skills demonstrated</strong>
         <ul>
  <li>Building and analyzing system dynamics models using feedback loops</li>
  <li>Exploring how changes in model parameters affect system behavior over time</li>
  <li>Translating complex system structures into interactive simulations</li>
  <li>Interpreting graphs and trends to understand real-world impacts</li>
</ul>
