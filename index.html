          <h2>Dynamic model of how infectious disease spread</h2>
          <p><strong>ISAT 290 | Final Project</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          James Madison University has an exclusive science major called ISAT (Integrated Science and Technology).
          This major is supposed to be a very broad science major that can lead to many different fields,
          such as environmental sustainability, data science, systems engineering, etc. In ISAT 290, a class focused
          on modeling feedback loops, my classmates and I created an infection diagram in Stella Architect to model
          how an infectious disease would realistically behave.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Stella Architect model simulates the spread of an infectious disease through a population using an
          extended SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework. Individuals transition between
          susceptible, exposed, infected, hospitalized, quarantined, recovered, and deceased states based on contact rates,
          time delays, and behavioral responses. The model incorporates public health interventions such as vaccination,
          quarantine, and social distancing, while also tracking cumulative outcomes including total deaths,
          hospitalizations, and economic costs. By allowing users to adjust intervention parameters and observe resulting
          feedback loops, the model demonstrates how behavioral and policy decisions influence both health and economic
          outcomes during an outbreak.

            <p><strong>What this model reveals</strong></p>
            <p>
              Interacting with the model highlights how small changes in behavior and policy can produce large differences
              in outcomes over time. The model demonstrates how reinforcing feedback loops can accelerate disease spread,
              while balancing loops such as increased awareness slow outbreaks.

            <p><strong>What I learned as a modeler</strong></p>
            <p>
              Building this system reinforced the importance of accounting for delays and human behavior when modeling complex
              systems. Additionally, the project emphasized the value of system dynamics as a tool for understanding real-world 
              problems that cannot be captured through static analysis alone.
