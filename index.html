        <h2>Integrated Science &amp; Technology Student</h2>
        <p>
          I am a sophomore ISAT student with interests in
          systems thinking, sustainability,
          and applied problem-solving.
          I enjoy translating complex systems into clear, real-world solutions
          through hands-on projects.

          <p><strong>ISAT 290| Dynamics Model of Infectious Disease Spread</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>
         James Madison University has a exclusive science major called ISAT (Integrated Science And Technology). 
         This major is supposed to be a very broad science major that is that can lead to many  different fields
          such as enviromental sustainability, data science, systems engineering, etc. In ISAT 290, a class focused
          on modeling feedback loops, my classmates and I created an infection diagram in Stella Architect to model 
          how an infectious disease would realistically behave.
        </p>
        <p>
           This Stella Architect model simulates the spread of an infectious disease through a population using an 
        extended SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework. Individuals transition between susceptible, 
        exposed, infected, hospitalized, quarantined, recovered, and deceased states based on contact rates, time delays,
        and behavioral responses. The model incorporates public health interventions such as vaccination, quarantine, and
        social distancing, while also tracking cumulative outcomes including total deaths, hospitalizations, and economic costs. 
        By allowing users to adjust intervention parameters and observe resulting feedback loops, the model demonstrates how 
        behavioral and policy decisions influence both health and economic outcomes during an outbreak.

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          After I collected the GIS data, I developed two primary types of signage:
          <strong>five ecosystem information boards</strong> describing distinct
          ecological zones, and <strong>fifteen plant identification signs</strong>
          highlighting native and invasive species throughout the preserve.
        </p>

        <p>
          I coordinated directly with <strong>Pulse Design</strong> to finalize
          sign layouts and materials, prioritizing durability and readability in
          an outdoor environment. After fabrication, I recruited and led
          volunteer teams to install the signage along the 1.6-mile trail,
          managing logistics, safety, and workflow throughout the process.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project planning &amp; execution across multiple phases and stakeholders</li>
          <li>Leadership &amp; volunteer coordination in a real-world outdoor environment</li>
          <li>Stakeholder communication with land trust staff and design professionals</li>
          <li>GIS data collection &amp; spatial mapping for trail planning and signage placement</li>
          <li>Public-facing technical communication for environmental education</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong>
          Successfully delivered a fully mapped <strong>1.6-mile trail system</strong>
          featuring over 20 professionally designed signs.
          The project improved visitor navigation, increased public awareness
          of local ecology and invasive species, and provided SALT with durable,
          long-term educational infrastructure.
