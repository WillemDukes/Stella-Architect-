        <p>
          I am a sophomore ISAT student with interests in systems thinking,
          sustainability, and applied problem-solving.
          I enjoy translating complex systems into clear, real-world solutions
          through hands-on projects.

          <h2>Dynamics Model of How Infectious Disease Spreads</h2>
          <p><strong>ISAT 290 | Final Project</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          James Madison University offers an interdisciplinary science major
          called ISAT (Integrated Science and Technology), designed to prepare
          students for a wide range of applied science and technology fields,
          including sustainability, data science, and systems engineering.
          In ISAT 290, a course focused on modeling feedback loops and system
          behavior, my classmates and I developed an infection dynamics model
          using Stella Architect to explore how an infectious disease would
          realistically spread through a population.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Stella Architect model simulates the spread of an infectious
          disease using an extended SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected,
          Recovered) framework. Individuals transition between susceptible,
          exposed, infected, hospitalized, quarantined, recovered, and deceased
          states based on contact rates, time delays, and behavioral responses.
          The model incorporates public health interventions such as vaccination,
          quarantine, and social distancing while tracking cumulative outcomes
          including total deaths, hospitalizations, and economic costs. By
          adjusting intervention parameters and observing resulting feedback
          loops, the model demonstrates how behavioral and policy decisions
          influence both health and economic outcomes during an outbreak.

        <h3>Model Insights &amp; Takeaways</h3>

        <p>
          Interacting with the model highlights how small changes in behavior
          and public health policy can produce large differences in outcomes
          over time. Adjustments to vaccination effectiveness, quarantine
          participation, or social distancing rapidly alter infection curves,
          hospitalization demand, and total economic costs. The simulation
          clearly illustrates how reinforcing feedback loops can accelerate
          disease spread, while balancing loops can slow or stabilize outbreaks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Developing this system reinforced the importance of accounting for
          delays, nonlinear relationships, and human behavior when modeling
          complex systems. Factors such as incubation periods, delayed
          hospitalization, and partial compliance significantly influence
          system behavior and make simple cause-and-effect assumptions
          unreliable. This project emphasized the value of system dynamics as a
          tool for understanding real-world problems that cannot be captured
          through static analysis alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond the classroom, this type of modeling has applications in public
          health planning, policy evaluation, and resource management. By
          simulating intervention strategies before they are implemented,
          decision-makers can better anticipate unintended consequences and
          evaluate tradeoffs between health outcomes and economic costs. This
          project reflects my interest in applying systems thinking to inform
          data-driven decision-making in complex, real-world environments.
